# The Mom Test Interview Kit

Distilled principles from Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test" for gathering honest customer feedback.

## Key Insights

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea** - Ask about past behavior and current problems, not future intentions about your solution.

2. **Ask about specifics, not generics** - "When did you last encounter this?" beats "Would you ever use this?"

3. **Bad data comes from compliments and hypotheticals** - "That's a great idea!" is worthless. "I spent 3 hours last week trying to solve this" is gold.

4. **People will lie to you** - Not maliciously, but to be nice. Your job is to structure conversations to get truth anyway.

5. **If they haven't tried to solve it, it's not a real problem** - Ask what they've already tried. No effort = low pain.

6. **Commitment and advancement, not compliments** - End conversations with asks: Will they intro you to others? Pay a deposit? Give you data?

7. **The more specific the pain, the better** - Vague frustration is weak signal. Specific stories with details are strong signal.

8. **Some problems aren't worth solving** - Even real problems may not be valuable enough to pay for. Validate willingness to pay.

9. **Keep it casual** - Formal interviews trigger formal (guarded) responses. Coffee chats get real talk.

10. **Understanding the customer's worldview matters more than validating your idea** - You're there to learn, not to pitch.

11. **Early conversations shape everything** - Wrong assumptions baked in now are expensive to fix later.

12. **Document religiously** - Your memory will lie to you. Write down exact quotes.

## When to Apply

**Trigger moments in PRD workflow:**
- Stage 3 (User & Scenarios): Defining who has the problem
- Stage 4 (Evidence & Assumptions): Evaluating evidence quality
- Anytime you're considering "Would users want this?"

## Question Templates

### Opening Questions
- "What's the hardest part about [doing the thing you're solving for]?"
- "Tell me about the last time that happened..."
- "How do you currently handle [problem area]?"

### Digging Deeper
- "Can you walk me through exactly what you did?"
- "What was happening right before that?"
- "What did you do next?"
- "Why did you choose that approach?"

### Quantifying Pain
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What did this cost you (time/money/stress)?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"

### Testing Commitment
- "Would you be willing to [specific action]?"
- "Who else should I talk to about this?"
- "If we built this, what would you need to try it?"

### Questions to AVOID
- ❌ "Would you use a product that..." (hypothetical)
- ❌ "Do you think this is a good idea?" (seeking approval)
- ❌ "How much would you pay for..." (before establishing value)
- ❌ "Would you be interested in..." (easy yes, meaningless)

## Evidence Quality Rubric

| Evidence Type | Quality | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| "I would definitely use that!" | Weak | Hypothetical, social compliance |
| "That's a common problem" | Weak | Vague, no personal stake |
| "I looked for a solution but couldn't find one" | Medium | Shows effort |
| "I built a spreadsheet to track this" | Strong | Invested effort = real pain |
| "I pay $X/month for a partial solution" | Strong | Demonstrated willingness to pay |
| "I spent 5 hours last week on this" | Strong | Quantified, specific, recent |
| "Let me intro you to 3 other people with this problem" | Very Strong | Active commitment |
| "Here's a deposit for when you launch" | Very Strong | Money talks |

## Common Misuses & Anti-patterns

### Anti-pattern 1: Pitching Disguised as Learning
- **Wrong**: "I'm building X. What do you think?"
- **Right**: "Tell me about your experience with [problem area]."

### Anti-pattern 2: Leading Questions
- **Wrong**: "Don't you find it frustrating when...?"
- **Right**: "What's frustrating about...?"

### Anti-pattern 3: Ignoring Body Language
- **Wrong**: Only recording what they say
- **Right**: Noting hesitation, excitement, or confusion

### Anti-pattern 4: Not Digging into "Why"
- **Wrong**: Accepting surface answers
- **Right**: Asking "Can you tell me more about that?" 3x

### Anti-pattern 5: Only Talking to Fans
- **Wrong**: Only interviewing people who already like your idea
- **Right**: Deliberately seeking skeptics and non-users

### Anti-pattern 6: Confirmation Bias
- **Wrong**: Remembering compliments, forgetting criticism
- **Right**: Documenting everything verbatim, especially disconfirming evidence

### Anti-pattern 7: Treating One Person as the Market
- **Wrong**: "I talked to someone who loved it!"
- **Right**: Pattern matching across multiple conversations
