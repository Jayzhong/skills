# Sprint Lite

Distilled principles from Jake Knapp's "Sprint" for rapid alignment and prototype-based validation, adapted for PRD development.

## Key Insights

1. **Time constraints force focus** - Parkinson's Law works in reverse: tight deadlines eliminate nice-to-haves and force prioritization.

2. **Work together alone** - Parallel individual work, then group synthesis. Avoids groupthink while leveraging diverse perspectives.

3. **Prototype before you build** - A realistic-looking prototype can answer questions in days that building would take months to answer.

4. **Test with 5 users** - 5 user tests surface 85% of usability issues. More users = diminishing returns.

5. **Start with the end in mind** - Define success criteria before exploring solutions. What would prove this works?

6. **Map before you solve** - Visualize the problem space before jumping to solutions.

7. **Experts bring insights, not solutions** - Interview internal experts early. They know pitfalls but shouldn't dictate outcomes.

8. **Vote, don't debate** - Structured voting beats endless discussion. Use dots, not arguments.

9. **Decide with the Decider** - One person has final call. Democracies deadlock; dictatorships decide.

10. **Focus on one target customer and scenario** - Narrow scope enables depth. Broad scope enables nothing.

11. **Lightning demos inspire, not dictate** - Look at how others solve related problems. Borrow ideas, don't copy products.

12. **Friday is for truth** - End the sprint with real user feedback, not team opinions.

## When to Apply

**Trigger moments in PRD workflow:**
- Stage 5 (Solution Shaping): Rapid exploration of solution approaches
- Stage 9 (Launch & Validation): Time-boxed validation cycles
- Anytime the team is stuck or debating endlessly

## 2-Day Sprint Variant for PRD

When a full 5-day sprint isn't feasible, use this condensed approach:

### Day 1: Understand & Sketch (4 hours)

**Hour 1: Map the Problem**
- Draw the customer journey for the target scenario
- Mark the problem moments
- Agree on the target (one specific moment to solve)

**Hour 2: Expert Lightning Talks**
- 15-min presentations from key stakeholders/experts
- Capture "How Might We" notes

**Hour 3: Lightning Demos**
- Each participant shares 1-2 examples of good solutions elsewhere
- Capture big ideas

**Hour 4: Sketch Solutions**
- Individual 4-step sketches (silent work)
- No group critique yet

### Day 2: Decide & Validate (4 hours)

**Hour 5: Solution Review**
- Silent review of all sketches
- Dot voting on compelling elements

**Hour 6: Decision Matrix**
- Debate only top-voted ideas
- Decider makes call

**Hour 7: Storyboard**
- Create 8-frame storyboard of the winning idea
- Enough detail to test with users

**Hour 8: User Feedback (or Plan)**
- Show storyboard to 3-5 target users
- Or: schedule sessions for following days

## Structured Voting Techniques

### Dot Voting
- Each person gets 3 dots
- Vote silently on favorite ideas
- Cluster votes reveal consensus

### Decider's Supervote
- After dot voting, Decider uses special votes
- Decider's votes break ties and make final call

### 2x2 Prioritization
- Plot ideas on Impact vs Effort grid
- Prioritize high-impact, low-effort first

## Common Misuses & Anti-patterns

### Anti-pattern 1: Sprint as Brainstorm
- **Wrong**: Use sprint format just to generate ideas
- **Right**: Sprint includes decision and validation, not just ideation

### Anti-pattern 2: Skipping the Prototype
- **Wrong**: Decide on solution, then go straight to building
- **Right**: Prototype and test before committing engineering resources

### Anti-pattern 3: No Decider
- **Wrong**: Try to reach consensus on everything
- **Right**: Designated Decider makes final calls (usually PM or founder)

### Anti-pattern 4: Testing with Colleagues
- **Wrong**: "Let's just test with the sales team"
- **Right**: Test with actual target users who represent your audience

### Anti-pattern 5: Ignoring Negative Feedback
- **Wrong**: User didn't understand it = user is wrong
- **Right**: User didn't understand it = design failed

### Anti-pattern 6: Going Too Broad
- **Wrong**: Try to validate the entire product in one sprint
- **Right**: Focus on one critical question or user path

### Anti-pattern 7: Perfect Prototype
- **Wrong**: Spend 3 days polishing the prototype
- **Right**: Make it "Goldilocks quality" - real enough to test, not a real product
