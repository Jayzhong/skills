# Go-to-Market: Crossing the Chasm

Distilled principles from Geoffrey Moore's "Crossing the Chasm" for technology adoption and market entry strategy.

## Key Insights

1. **The Technology Adoption Lifecycle** - Innovators → Early Adopters → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards. These are distinct groups with different buying psychology.

2. **The Chasm exists** - Between Early Adopters (visionaries) and Early Majority (pragmatists) lies a dangerous gap. Most tech products die here.

3. **Visionaries vs Pragmatists** - Visionaries want revolution and competitive advantage. Pragmatists want evolution and proven solutions. They don't reference each other.

4. **Whole Product is essential** - Pragmatists buy complete solutions. "Just the technology" isn't enough. What else is needed to accomplish the use case?

5. **Beachhead first** - Dominate one small segment completely before expanding. Choose a niche where you can be #1.

6. **Create the compelling reason to buy** - For pragmatists: quantified pain + proof it works + low-risk path.

7. **Competitive positioning matters** - Pragmatists compare you to alternatives. Name your category and competitors deliberately.

8. **References are currency** - Pragmatists need to hear from other pragmatists. Build reference customers in your beachhead.

9. **Channel strategy changes by segment** - Visionaries tolerate direct sales; pragmatists expect industry standard channels.

10. **Pricing signals market positioning** - Price communicates where you fit. Premium = established category leader. Discount = challenger.

11. **Bowling pin strategy** - Each segment you dominate becomes a reference for adjacent segments. Line up your pins.

12. **Crossing takes focus, not breadth** - You cross by going narrow, not wide. Serve one segment insanely well.

## When to Apply

**Trigger moments in PRD workflow:**
- Stage 3 (User & Scenarios): Choosing which user to serve first
- Stage 6 (MVP Scope): Scoping for beachhead, not mass market
- Stage 9 (Launch & Validation): Planning market entry

## Segment Comparison

| Characteristic | Early Adopters (Visionaries) | Early Majority (Pragmatists) |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Motivation | Competitive advantage, revolution | Incremental improvement, evolution |
| Risk tolerance | High; will bet on unproven | Low; needs proof and references |
| Reference check | Other visionaries | Other pragmatists in same industry |
| Whole product need | Will build around gaps | Needs complete solution |
| Relationship | Direct to founders | Through established channels |
| Pricing sensitivity | Will pay premium for advantage | Expects market pricing |

## Beachhead Selection Criteria

Choose a segment where:

1. **Real, funded pain** - They have budget and urgency to solve the problem
2. **Reachable** - You can access them through existing channels
3. **Small enough to dominate** - You can be #1 with available resources
4. **Big enough to matter** - Segment revenue can fund next steps
5. **Strategic value** - Success here opens doors to adjacent segments
6. **Whole product is feasible** - You can deliver complete solution
7. **Referenceable** - Wins here will impress adjacent segments

## Whole Product Concept

Core product alone is rarely enough. Map:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                POTENTIAL PRODUCT                │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │           AUGMENTED PRODUCT             │   │
│  │  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │   │
│  │  │        EXPECTED PRODUCT           │  │   │
│  │  │  ┌─────────────────────────────┐  │  │   │
│  │  │  │      CORE PRODUCT           │  │  │   │
│  │  │  │   (what you ship)           │  │  │   │
│  │  │  └─────────────────────────────┘  │  │   │
│  │  │   + Integration, support, docs    │  │   │
│  │  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │   │
│  │    + Training, customization, add-ons   │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│       + Ecosystem, community, extensions        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For your beachhead, define what's needed at each level.

## Positioning Statement Template

For [target segment] 
who [statement of need], 
[product name] is a [product category] 
that [statement of key benefit]. 
Unlike [primary competitive alternative], 
our product [statement of primary differentiation].

**Example:**
For small law firms who struggle with document version control, LegalDocs is a document management system that ensures every team member always has the latest version. Unlike SharePoint, our product is designed specifically for legal workflows with built-in redlining and matter organization.

## Common Misuses & Anti-patterns

### Anti-pattern 1: Boiling the Ocean
- **Wrong**: "Our market is everyone who uses software"
- **Right**: "Our beachhead is 10-person engineering teams at B2B SaaS startups"

### Anti-pattern 2: Premature Scaling
- **Wrong**: Expand to new segments before dominating the first
- **Right**: Be the undisputed leader in beachhead before moving

### Anti-pattern 3: Visionary References for Pragmatists
- **Wrong**: "Company X's innovation team uses us"
- **Right**: "Company X's mainstream operations deployed us across 500 users"

### Anti-pattern 4: Ignoring Whole Product
- **Wrong**: Ship core product, expect customers to figure out the rest
- **Right**: Partner/build/buy to deliver complete solution

### Anti-pattern 5: Generic Positioning
- **Wrong**: "We're a better X"
- **Right**: Specific differentiation for specific segment

### Anti-pattern 6: Pricing That Confuses
- **Wrong**: Freemium for enterprise pragmatists
- **Right**: Pricing model that matches buyer expectations

### Anti-pattern 7: Wrong Channel for Segment
- **Wrong**: Direct sales to SMB pragmatists (too expensive)
- **Right**: Channel strategy matched to segment economics
